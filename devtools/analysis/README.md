# What is this?
These are just a few scripts I occasionally use to run Yauaa as part of a pipeline in Elastic Search... locally on my machine in docker.

I usually copy these to a separate "working" location out or sight of IntelliJ as that would make it see a LOT of files ... which makes everything very slow.

I use this to find unexpected agents and patterns to base new rules upon.

In the loader directory is a Flink based tool that does this by fully utilizing all CPU cores on my machine.
